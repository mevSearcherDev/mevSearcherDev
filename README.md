Applied Research in On-Chain Arbitrage, AI-Powered MEV Strategies, and High-Performance DeFi Bots

---

## 🚀 About Us
We design, test, and deploy AI-driven, high-performance bots for:
- 🏦 DEX Arbitrage — exploiting cross-pool and cross-DEX price inefficiencies.
- ⚡️ Sandwich Attacks — precision frontrunning and backrunning.
- 💸 Liquidation Capture — seizing undercollateralized positions in lending markets.
- ⛽️ Gas Optimization — cutting execution costs to outbid competition.

Our work blends:
- 🖥 Solidity Engineering
- 🤖 AI-Optimized Trade Routing
- 🔒 Flashbots Execution
- 📊 Data-Driven Simulation & Backtesting

---

## 🔬 Research Focus Areas
- Flashloan-Based Arbitrage Engines — Uniswap V2/V3, SushiSwap, Curve, Balancer.
- Post-Sequencer MEV Extraction — targeting L2 ordering patterns.
- Dynamic Pathfinding — AI-generated trade routes for maximum profit.
- Risk & Security Audits — internal MEV bot hardening and exploit surface reduction.
